C Algorithm

Complexity: O(1) < O(lgn) < O(n) < O(nlgn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)

O(1)    Fetching the first element from a set of data
O(lgn)  Splitting a set of data in half, then splitting the halves in half, etc.
O(n)    Traversing a set of data
O(nlgn) Splitting a set of data in half repeatedly and traversing each half
O(n^2)  Traversing a set of data once for each member of another set of equal size
O(2^n)   Generating all possible subsets of a set of data
O(n!)   Generating all possible permutations of a set of data
